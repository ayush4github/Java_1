        // The main differences between primitive and non-primitive data types are:
        // 1. Primitive data types in Java are predefined and built into the language, while non-primitive data types are created by programmer (except for 'String').
        // 2. Non-primitive types can be used to call method to perform certain operations, which primitive types cannot.
        // 3. Primitive types start with a lowercase letter (like 'int'), while non-primitive types typically starts with an uppercase letter (like 'String').
        // 4. Primitive types always hold a value, whereas non-primitive types can be 'null'.
